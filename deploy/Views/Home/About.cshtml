            I currently work as a developer maintaining ASP and .NET web applications, but I'm fairly agnostic regarding technology
            and try to always explore what is the best approach for a project and why. My work is pretty varied, so in a typical day
            I may handle anything from working on PayPal integration to troubleshooting a classic ASP DLL. I am also currently a student
            working towards a Master's Degree in Computer Science with an expected completion date in the Fall of 2018.

            Previously, I had the good fortune to
            have worked as a systems administrator in a mixed Windows, Unix, and Mac environment for a number of years which has helped
            me as a developer in understanding networking, protocols, and tools and approaches that are handy for debugging and troubleshooting.

            Before all of that, I worked in graphic design building Flash animations, web graphics, and laying out print design. I am very
            comfortable using Adobe Creative Cloud tools including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.

            When I'm not in the land of bits I love running, playing and building guitars, and hanging out with my kids.
