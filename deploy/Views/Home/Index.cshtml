            <h2>What I do</h2>
            <p>
                I currently work as a full-stack developer maintaining a number of .NET and ASP applications.
                I handle a mix of everything from Javascript and CSS to writing stored procedures for SQL Server and building ASP and .NET functionality.
            </p>
            <p>In my current job I've worked with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ASP, .NET MVC, and WebForms</li>
                <li>Windows Authentication integration with Active Directory</li>
                <li>Javascript, CSS, and HTML</li>
                <li>SQL Server and T-SQL</li>
                <li>IIS Configuration</li>
                <li>Bootstrap and JQuery</li>
                <li>Python and Bash scripting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>
                If you'd like to see some of my work I have a number of test sites running on various platforms.
                Currently, I am running a .NET MVC application built to explore the Entity Framework,
                LINQ, and deployment to Azure; a MEAN stack application running AngularJS with MongoDB; and a Ruby on Rails site
                that was a software engineering class group project.

                    I also have a MEAN stack application and a Ruby on Rails site up and running, but both require authentication to access. Contact me via Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/JohnHovanec">@@JohnHovanec</a> if you'd like to see more.

                <li>Javascript ES2017</li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>.NET Core</li>
