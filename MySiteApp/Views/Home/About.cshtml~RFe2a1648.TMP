            <p>
                I currently work as a developer maintaining ASP and .NET web applications, but I'm fairly agnostic regarding technology
                and try to always explore what is the best approach for a project and why. My work is pretty varied, so in a typical day
                I may handle anything from working on PayPal integration to troubleshooting a classic ASP DLL.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also currently a student
                working towards a master's degree in Computer Science with an expected completion date in the Fall of 2018.

            <h3>Previously ... </h3>
            <p>
                Previously, I had the good fortune to have worked as a systems administrator in a mixed Windows, Unix, and Mac environment for a number of years.
                That experience has helped me as a developer in understanding networking, protocols, and tools that are useful for debugging and troubleshooting
                networking issues. I also performed a good deal of application and end-user support which was also a great learning experience.

            <h3>A long time ago ... </h3>
            <p>
                Before all of that, I worked in graphic design building Flash animations, web graphics, print catalogs, and front-end HTML and CSS work. I am very
                comfortable using Adobe Creative Cloud tools including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not in the land of bits I love running, playing and building guitars, and hanging out with my kids.
